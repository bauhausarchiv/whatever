# whatever
First draft of the thing.

## HI 

So I think something exciting can be done. It may be the best idea ever, or just me losing 1 hour i've would have used to nothing.
First thing first, i've tried to secure things as possible to be anonymous, if you think so i'll be glad to be transparent about who i am but if it's a bad idea i tried to secure things a little bit.
Actually i think that whatever you try to do if someone want to find who you are he will. But for now, letÂ´s stop talking about that.


This is a start, or as i said, nothing. Both are equal, but at least we can try.

## THE IDEA

## Make a collaborative plateform with local roots.

 <quote>An Open-sourcr, transparent democratic evolutive international structure to make things better.</quote>
 
- Real life local strucures to make things together.
